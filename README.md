## Objectives 



Dr. Micheal McDonald is a political science professor at the University of Florida, where he runs the US Elections Project: an innovative and important data collection and reporting project. A summary of the work can be found on [McDonald’s Website](http://www.electproject.org/.). In his own [repository](https://github.com/mcdisc/UF-Election-Sciences), McDonald uses elections data scrapped from a number of states in order to create visualizations for both his websites and blog positing for the Huffington Post and other publications. 

The work produced in the Elections Project takes on two forms: histograms and maps. In regards to the histograms, the plots appear to be made in excel, with no predictability and low-image resolution. Additionally, the histograms are generated from large data files, which are downloaded manually on a frequent basis. The maps are similar, in that they are not reproducible and appear to be made in an inefficient manner. 

The goal of this project is to assist Dr. McDonald in creating “timely and accurate election statistics", by producing interactive, automated visualizations that are fully-reproducible. 







## Implementation

Our group focused on North Carolina, where voter registration data is free and readily accessible from their Board of Elections.
